<h1>Welcome to Noita Wands!</h1>

<p>This website is meant to be a guide for wands and wandbuilding in the game Noita. I was confused at how wandbuilding worked at first so I wanted to make this website for myself, and to help others in their wandbuilding endevours.</p>

<h2>Wand Basics</h2>
<h3>Shuffle</h3>
<p>If <strong>Yes</strong>, the wand will pick a spell slot at random to fire. 
  If <strong>No</strong>, the wand will fire the spell slots in order.</p>
<p><i>Note: In general, you will wnat wands with shuffle set to <strong>no</strong> if you are using spell modifiers.</i></p>
<h3>Spells/Cast</h3>
<p>This will be the number of spell slots that are cast with each click of the mouse. 
  A wand with a Spells/Cast of 2 will cast 2 spells every click.</p>
<h3>Cast Delay</h3>
<p>The amount of time between casts.</p>
<h3>Recharge Time</h3>
<p>The amount of time a wand must recharge after all the spells slots in a wand have been fired.</p>
<p><i>Note: Cast Delay and Recharge Time are independent, meaning that if you Cast Delay and Recharge time are similar,
  you won't notice the Recharge Time.</i></p>
<h3>Mana Max</h3>
<p>The maximum mana value this wand can hold. Spells have a mana cost, and must be matched with a wand that can handle them.</p>
<h3>Mana Charge Speed</h3>
<p>The time it takes for a wand to recharge it's mana supply.</p>
<h3>Capacity</h3>
<p>The number of spell slots available.</p>
<h3>Spread</h3>
<p>The amount of accuracy the wand has. If you have a wand with high spread, it will be similar to a shotgun for example.</p>
<p><i>Note: Spells also have spread values, and these compound with a wands spread values as well.</i></p>
<h3>Always Casts</h3>
<p>This is a special attribute that some wands possess. It means that on each cast, the "always casts" spell will be cast along with another spell.</p>
